# Nengs_Cyber_Security
A repository containing all of my files and certificates in Cyber security
Good day, Recruitment officer and any other persons who may come accross this git repo. My name is Onengiye David- West; Onengiye being a short form of te full name TamunOnengiye Ofori meaning tere is nothing greater than God in the Kalabari sub dialect of the Ijaw tribe of the south south geopolitical zone of Nigeria. My nick name to most people should be Nengs or Nengi but from now on the cyber security and hacking spaces i shall go by the pseudonym or call sign Ø>†. seems cool huh. so this repository has all my work and abilities in computer science and cyber security for all to see... im always learning something new so you might see a lot of incomplete junk. bear with me i know what im doing.
